tail -f log/status_summary.log    # Status summary
```

### Key Monitoring Metrics
- **Position Status**: Long/short position quantities
- **Order Status**: Quantities and prices of various order types
- **Spread Monitoring**: Bid-ask price difference percentage
- **Risk Indicators**: Position threshold proximity
- **System Status**: WebSocket connection and data sync status

## 🧠 Trading Logic

### Grid Strategy Overview
1. **Initialization**: Place entry orders when positions are zero
2. **Position Management**: Place profit-taking and averaging orders when positions exist
3. **Risk Control**: Enable double profit-taking when position exceeds `POSITION_LIMIT`
4. **Spread Control**: Realign grids when spread exceeds threshold
5. **Safety Measures**: Partial position closing and order timeout management

### Risk Management Features
- **Position Thresholds**: Automatic position limits with configurable thresholds
- **Spread Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring with automatic correction
- **Order Management**: Timeout handling and cooldown mechanisms
- **Inventory Control**: Bidirectional position balance management

### 🚨 Emergency Position Reduction Logic
1. **Trigger Conditions**:
   - **Normal Mode**: Triggers when both long/short positions ≥ 0.8× `POSITION_THRESHOLD`
   - **Extreme Volatility**: Automatically adjusts to 0.75× threshold during high volatility periods
   - **Volatility Detection**: Monitors price changes over 60 periods to identify extreme conditions

2. **Execution Process**:
   - **Order Cancellation**: Cancels all non-take-profit orders for affected directions
   - **Batched Reduction**: Divides reduction into configurable batches (default: 2 batches)
   - **Smart Ordering**: Attempts limit orders with slippage tolerance, falls back to market orders
   - **Position Refresh**: Refreshes positions before each batch to ensure accuracy

3. **Post-Reduction Actions**:
   - **Grid Pause**: Pauses new grid orders for 60-120 seconds
   - **Daily Circuit Breaker**: Activates after 3 daily triggers, halting new positions for the day

### 🔒 Lockdown Mode Logic
1. **Activation Conditions**:
   - **Single Direction**: Triggers when long or short position exceeds 1× `POSITION_THRESHOLD`
   - **Take-Profit Calculation**: Computes optimal take-profit price based on position ratios
   - **Price Constraints**: Applies min/max constraints to prevent extreme take-profit levels

2. **Operation Mode**:
   - **Position Freeze**: Stops opening new positions in the affected direction
   - **Fixed Take-Profit**: Maintains take-profit orders at calculated price levels
   - **Order Management**: Only places take-profit orders, no new entry orders

3. **Exit Conditions**:
   - **Automatic Exit**: Exits lockdown mode when position returns below 1× threshold
   - **Normal Operation**: Resumes standard grid trading operations
   - **State Reset**: Clears lockdown mode flags and take-profit price records

## 🐳 Docker Architecture

- **Base Image**: Python 3.9 Slim
- **Runtime User**: Non-root user (trader)
- **Resource Limits**: Memory 512M, CPU 0.5 cores
- **Health Check**: Program status check every 30 seconds
- **Auto Restart**: Automatic restart on abnormal exit

## ⚠️ Security & Risk Management

### API Security
- **Permission Settings**: Enable only necessary contract trading permissions
- **IP Whitelist**: Set API IP whitelist in exchange
- **Key Protection**: Never commit `.env` file to version control

### Risk Control Recommendations
- **Test Environment**: Run on testnet or small capital environment first
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust grid spacing and quantities based on currency characteristics
- **Position Monitoring**: Regularly check position status to avoid over-concentration
- **Market Adaptation**: Consider pausing bot during extreme market conditions

### System Security
- **Network Isolation**: Containers run in isolated network environment
- **Log Management**: Regular log file cleanup to prevent disk space issues
- **Permission Control**: Non-root user execution to reduce security risks

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Failure**
   ```bash
   # Check API configuration
   grep API_KEY .env
   
   # View error logs
   ./scripts/deploy.sh logs
   
   # Test connectivity
   curl -I https://fapi.binance.com
   ```

2. **Container Startup Issues**
   ```bash
   # Check configuration
   docker-compose config
   
   # View container status
   docker ps -a
   
   # Check resources
   docker stats
   ```

3. **Permission Issues**
   ```bash
   # Fix log directory permissions
   chmod 755 log/
   sudo chown 1000:1000 log/
   ```

### Performance Optimization
- Adjust `SYNC_TIME` to balance real-time performance and efficiency
- Monitor memory usage and restart container when necessary
- Adjust container resource limits based on server performance

## 📞 Support

For issues and questions:
1. Check log files for detailed error information
2. Verify configuration parameters are correct
3. Confirm exchange API permission settings
4. Test network connectivity and exchange service status

### Performance Recommendations
- Use Binance for most comprehensive features and best performance
- Start with single currency mode for beginners
- Gradually scale to multi-currency mode for experienced users
- Monitor system resources and adjust container limits accordingly

## 📈 Risk Warning

**⚠️ Important Disclaimer**: This software is for educational and research purposes only. Users bear all trading risks. Grid trading may face significant losses in trending markets. Please use with caution based on your risk tolerance.

**Key Risk Factors**:
- Grid trading is suitable for sideways markets, trending markets carry higher risks
- Leveraged trading is extremely risky and may result in total capital loss
- Ensure full understanding of trading mechanisms before use
- Consider setting stop-loss mechanisms to avoid major losses in extreme situations

**🚨 Emergency System Considerations**:
- **Emergency Reduction**: May trigger during high volatility, resulting in position closures
- **Lockdown Mode**: Can pause trading in one direction, affecting overall strategy performance
- **Daily Circuit Breaker**: Extreme protection may halt all new positions for extended periods

**📊 Risk Management Tips**:
- Start with small amounts and gradually increase
- Monitor positions regularly and adjust parameters as needed
- Consider market conditions when deciding to run the bot
- Always maintain adequate account balance for margin requirements
